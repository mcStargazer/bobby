This repo contains materials for a talk, "I Spy with MySQLi", given at the OKCPython Meetup on Jan 09, 2019.
Details on the venue can be found at https://www.meetup.com/okcpython/events/vtdhfpyzcbmb/. The purpose is to raise awareness of security issues so every webapp can run more safely and do it's intended job.

To run "the_app.py" you'll need a software environment similar to mine. The Python environment I used is detailed in the "environment.yml" (exported with conda). You'll also need a mysql server with a user that has SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE, DROP grants on the database you will use. My mysql server details are: Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.24, for Linux (x86_64), and is running on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. I should note that I had to backup to Python 2

Legal Notice: Penetration testing should only be conducted within an isolated testing environment that you own, or for a client with whom clear rules of engagement have been agreed upon and contracted. Let's keep our hacking ethical!
